## 🌍 Overview

**ThisIsHavana.com** is not a travel guide.

It is a city identity site built on one core truth:

> **Havana is not one place — it is many living organisms sharing the same coastline.**

This site rejects:
- tourist zoning  
- hierarchy of neighborhoods  
- postcard-only narratives  
- frozen-in-time romanticism  

Instead, Havana is presented as it actually exists:
> **alive_toggle movement, memory, routine, and contradiction.**

---

## 🎯 Core Positioning

Havana is often flattened into:
- old cars  
- old buildings  
- nostalgia  
- spectacle  

ThisIsHavana refuses that reduction.

Each barrio is treated as:
- its own ecosystem  
- its own rhythm  
- its own logic  
- its own sense of time  

No neighborhood exists “for tourists.”
Every neighborhood exists **for the people who live there.**

---

## 🧠 Core Idea

Havana is best understood **laterally**, not hierarchically.

You don’t rank neighborhoods.
You listen to them.

---

## 🏙️ Neighborhoods as Living Organisms (Core Framework)

Each barrio is treated like its own city.

### Habana Vieja — Layered Time
- colonial density
- layered centuries
- preservation + daily life
- ritual, work, and survival in tight space

### Centro Habana — Density + Motion
- compressed living
- street-level economy
- sound, movement, urgency
- the city breathing at full volume

### Vedado — Ideas + Institutions
- universities
- theaters
- politics and culture
- long blocks, long conversations

### Miramar — Space + Contrast
- embassies and margins
- wide streets
- inequality made visible
- silence and separation

### Marianao — Memory + Rhythm
- Afro-Cuban roots
- music and movement
- working-class pride
- cultural continuity

No hierarchy.
No “best area.”
No sanitization.

---

## 🎶 Sound, Movement, Routine (Core Lens)

Havana is understood through:
- sound before sight  
- routines before attractions  
- movement before monuments  

ThisIsHavana focuses on:
- morning rhythms
- street conversations
- evening music
- informal economies

---

## 🍲 Food, Survival, Ingenuity

Food is not a “scene.”

Food is:
- logistics
- adaptation
- sharing
- resilience

- neighborhood food systems

## 🧠 Core Philosophy

ThisIsHavana does not explain Havana *to* people.

It listens to Havana *with* people.

LLMs are used to:
- structure multilingual content
- support contributor workflows
- connect routines across barrios
- scale discovery without flattening

Humans are required to:
- protect dignity
- avoid nostalgia traps
- prevent voyeurism
- preserve local voice

---

## 🗂️ Content Architecture (LLM-Native)

ThisIsHavana is built around **neighborhood + routine entities**.

### Core Entities
- Barrio
- Routine
- Street
- Soundscape
- Food System
- Cultural Practice
- Story
- Voice
- Evidence
- Collection

Each entity:
- has a stable schema
- has a canonical URL
- cross-links laterally across barrios
- is programmatically generatable
