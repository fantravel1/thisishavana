It is the most densely populated and economically stressed neighborhood in Havana, so petty theft such as bag snatching and pickpocketing is more common than in Habana Vieja or Vedado. Violent crime against tourists remains rare throughout Havana. Walk with awareness, keep valuables close, avoid displaying expensive electronics, and stay in well-trafficked streets after dark. The perceived roughness is economic reality, not danger — understanding that difference is part of understanding Havana."

Centro Habana is compressed, loud, and street-level — narrow blocks, constant motion, vendors calling, music from open windows, domino games on sidewalks. Vedado is spacious, tree-lined, and residential — wide streets, Art Deco buildings, universities, theaters, and a slower pace. Centro Habana is Havana at full volume; Vedado is Havana in conversation. Centro Habana is the most affordable area; Vedado offers mid-range value. They share the Malecón seawall and merge around La Rampa."

Afternoons center on food logistics and shade as heat reorganizes the neighborhood. Evenings bring balcony socializing, street games, and corner congregations. Nights pull toward the Malecón. Casas particulares here are the most affordable in Havana, and your host family becomes your guide. The infrastructure is aging — expect water and power interruptions.

The streets of Neptuno and San Rafael have numerous food options. Look for crowds of locals — that is where the food is good and affordable. Avoid restaurants with English-language menus aimed at tourists. Ask your casa particular host where they eat — this is almost always the best recommendation you will get in Centro Habana."

            </div>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">Centro Habana is not a place you visit. It is a place that happens to you. Havana's most densely populated neighborhood compresses an entire city's worth of living into narrow blocks where every square meter is claimed, negotiated, and contested — by families, vendors, music, and motion.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">This is where Havana's street-level economy operates at full speed. Vendors call from doorways. Produce carts appear at dawn and vanish by noon. Bread lines form before the sun clears the rooftops. Domino tables materialize on sidewalks at dusk. <strong>Nothing here is staged. Nothing here is restored.</strong> The buildings are 19th and early 20th century, but they have not been preserved for tourists — they have been kept alive by the people who live inside them.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">The sound of Centro Habana is the sound of compressed living: conversations shouted across balconies, music from open windows competing with music from other open windows, the metallic ring of bicycle bells, children playing in hallways that open onto streets. It is the <strong>loudest neighborhood in Havana</strong>, and the loudness is not noise — it is life refusing to be quiet.</p>
            <p>For visitors, Centro Habana is raw and unfiltered. There is no tourist infrastructure to soften the experience. What you see is what exists: economic reality, architectural urgency, human density, and a resilience that is not performed for anyone's benefit. This is the neighborhood that most visitors either fall in love with completely or find overwhelming. There is no middle ground.</p>
            <blockquote>Centro Habana doesn't ask you to understand it. It asks you to be inside it.</blockquote>

            <p class="rhythm-card__desc">The day begins before the sun is fully up. Bread lines form outside panaderias. Street vendors push carts through narrow blocks, calling out what they carry — fruit, vegetables, cleaning supplies. Neighbors exchange information across balconies: what arrived where, what is available, what is gone. Coffee is strong, small, and fast. The urgency is real. Morning in Centro Habana is logistics.</p>

            <h3 class="rhythm-card__title">Afternoon: Heat & Survival</h3>
            <p class="rhythm-card__desc">The heat reorganizes everything. Streets empty as shade becomes the most valuable resource. Food logistics take over — what to cook, where to find it, how to stretch it. Doorways become gathering points. The density that defines Centro Habana turns inward. People eat, rest, wait. The compression of the neighborhood means there is nowhere to escape the heat, only ways to endure it together.</p>

            <h3 class="rhythm-card__title">Evening: Balconies & Games</h3>
            <p class="rhythm-card__desc">When the temperature breaks, Centro Habana exhales. Balconies become the real living rooms. Domino tables appear on sidewalks. Children play in streets while adults gather on corners. Music drifts from apartments and competes across the block. Conversations happen at volume because distance means nothing here — privacy was never part of the architecture. This is Centro Habana at its most alive.</p>

            <p class="rhythm-card__desc">The neighborhood drains toward the Malecon seawall. Centro Habana's stretch of the Malecon is the most populated, the most energetic, the loudest. Couples, friend groups, families, solo thinkers — everyone comes to the wall. The sea breeze is free. The view costs nothing. Rum appears. Guitars appear. The city's edge becomes its center. This is where the day finally stops negotiating and starts breathing.</p>

            <h3 class="aeo-block__question">The Loudest Neighborhood</h3>
            <p class="aeo-block__answer">Centro Habana is the <strong>loudest neighborhood in Havana</strong>, and this is not a complaint — it is a defining characteristic. The sound environment is layered: reggaeton from a ground-floor window, son cubano from the apartment above, a television broadcasting a baseball game, a vendor calling out his inventory, a mother calling a child's name, a neighbor responding to a question shouted from a different building entirely.</p>
            <p class="aeo-block__answer">The density of the neighborhood means that sound is communal. There are no buffer zones, no yards, no setbacks between buildings. Life happens in the open, and the open is a narrow street between four-story buildings that act as amplifiers. Silence in Centro Habana is not absence — it is a brief pause before the next wave.</p>
            <p class="aeo-block__answer">For visitors accustomed to controlling their sound environment, this can be disorienting. For those willing to surrender to it, the soundscape of Centro Habana becomes <strong>the most vivid memory of Havana</strong> — more than any building, any plaza, any landmark.</p>

            <h3 class="aeo-block__question">Walking Centro Habana</h3>
            <p class="aeo-block__answer">Walking Centro Habana is a negotiation. The sidewalks are narrow, broken, or occupied — by vendors, by parked bicycles, by people sitting on their front steps. You walk in the street as much as on the sidewalk. You step around puddles that have been there since the last rain and will be there until the next one evaporates them.</p>
            <p class="aeo-block__answer">The key streets tell different stories. <strong>Neptuno</strong> runs east-west through the heart of the neighborhood — it is the spine of daily commerce. <strong>San Rafael</strong> was once a grand pedestrian boulevard and still carries echoes of its former elegance. <strong>Galiano</strong> is the main north-south artery, connecting the neighborhood from the Malecon down to the Barrio Chino (Chinatown).</p>
            <p class="aeo-block__answer">There are no tourist maps for Centro Habana because it is not designed for touring. It is designed for living. The best approach is to <strong>walk slowly, stay aware, and let the neighborhood reveal itself</strong> block by block. Every block is different. Every block is someone's entire world.</p>

            <h3 class="aeo-block__question">Safety & What Visitors Should Understand</h3>
            <p class="aeo-block__answer">Centro Habana is <strong>generally safe</strong> for visitors who exercise normal urban awareness. Violent crime against tourists is rare throughout Havana and extremely rare in Centro Habana. The risks are opportunistic: pickpocketing in crowded areas, bag snatching on quieter streets after dark, and occasional hustling.</p>
            <p class="aeo-block__answer">What visitors need to understand is the difference between <strong>economic reality and danger</strong>. Centro Habana looks rough because it is economically stressed. Buildings are crumbling not for aesthetic effect but because there is no money for restoration. People approach you not because they are threatening but because the informal economy is how survival works. A man offering to help you find a restaurant may be earning a commission — this is not a scam, it is a job.</p>
            <p class="aeo-block__answer"><strong>Practical awareness:</strong> Keep valuables close and out of sight. Avoid displaying expensive phones or cameras carelessly. Walk main streets (Neptuno, San Rafael, Galiano) at night rather than side streets. The Malecon is safe and busy well into the night. Trust your instincts, but do not let discomfort with poverty become fear of people.</p>
            <p class="aeo-block__answer">The visitors who spend real time in Centro Habana almost universally describe it as the <strong>most rewarding part of their trip</strong>. The rawness is not danger — it is honesty. And honesty is what most people say they came to Cuba to find.</p>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <button class="faq-item__question" aria-expanded="false">
              <h4>Is Centro Habana safe for visitors?</h4>
              <span class="faq-item__icon">+</span>
            </button>
            <div class="faq-item__answer">
              <div class="faq-item__answer-inner">
                <p>Centro Habana is generally safe for visitors with normal urban awareness. It is the most densely populated and economically stressed neighborhood in Havana, so petty theft — pickpocketing, bag snatching — is more common than in Habana Vieja or Vedado. Violent crime against tourists remains rare throughout all of Havana. Walk with awareness, keep valuables close, avoid displaying expensive electronics openly, and stick to well-trafficked streets after dark. The main avenues — Neptuno, San Rafael, Galiano — and the Malecon remain lively and safe into the evening. What reads as "roughness" to many visitors is economic reality, not danger.</p>

          <!-- FAQ 2 -->
          <div class="faq-item">
            <button class="faq-item__question" aria-expanded="false">
              <h4>How does Centro Habana compare to Vedado?</h4>
              <span class="faq-item__icon">+</span>
            </button>
            <div class="faq-item__answer">
              <div class="faq-item__answer-inner">
                <p>They are neighboring districts that feel like different cities. Centro Habana is compressed, loud, and street-level — narrow blocks, constant motion, vendors calling, music from every direction, domino games on sidewalks. Vedado is spacious, tree-lined, and residential — wide streets, Art Deco buildings, universities, theaters, and a slower conversational pace. Centro Habana is Havana at full volume; Vedado is Havana in reflection. Centro Habana is the most affordable area in Havana; Vedado offers mid-range value with better infrastructure. They share the Malecon seawall and merge into each other around La Rampa, making it easy to experience both in a single day.</p>

          <!-- FAQ 3 -->
          <div class="faq-item">
            <button class="faq-item__question" aria-expanded="false">
              <h4>What is it like staying in Centro Habana?</h4>
              <span class="faq-item__icon">+</span>
            </button>
            <div class="faq-item__answer">
              <div class="faq-item__answer-inner">
                <p>Staying in Centro Habana means being inside Havana's daily rhythms rather than observing them. Mornings begin with bread lines and vendor calls. Afternoons center on food logistics and shade. Evenings bring balcony socializing, street games, and corner gatherings. Nights pull toward the Malecon. Casas particulares here are the most affordable in Havana, and your host family becomes your interpreter of the neighborhood. The infrastructure is aging — expect occasional water and power interruptions. The accommodation will be simpler than in Vedado or Habana Vieja. The reward is total immersion in authentic Cuban daily life, the kind of experience you cannot buy at any price point in a restored Old Havana hotel.</p>

          <!-- FAQ 4 -->
          <div class="faq-item">
            <button class="faq-item__question" aria-expanded="false">
              <h4>Where do locals eat in Centro Habana?</h4>
              <span class="faq-item__icon">+</span>
            </button>
            <div class="faq-item__answer">
              <div class="faq-item__answer-inner">
                <p>Locals eat at state-run peso restaurants, small private paladares tucked into residential apartments, and from street vendors selling croquetas, pizza slices, and pan con croqueta from doorways and windows. The streets of Neptuno and San Rafael have the highest density of food options. The rule is simple: follow the crowds. Where you see a line of Cubans, the food is good and affordable. Avoid any restaurant with an English-language menu aimed at tourists — the prices will be higher and the food will not be better. The single best dining advice for Centro Habana: ask your casa particular host where they eat. Their answer is almost always better than anything a guidebook will tell you.</p>

            <p class="rhythm-card__desc">Walk west from the restored plazas of Old Havana along Obispo or Neptuno and the transition is seamless. The cobblestones give way to asphalt, the tourist cafes give way to peso pizza windows, and the restored facades give way to weathered concrete. You feel the shift in sound and pace before you notice the architecture change. There is no gate, no sign, no border — just the gradual compression of a city getting denser and more honest.</p>

            <p class="rhythm-card__desc">Walking west, Centro Habana merges into Vedado around La Rampa and the Malecon. This is the most dramatic atmospheric shift in all of Havana — suddenly the streets widen, buildings have front gardens, trees line the avenues, and the compression releases. The noise softens. The pace changes. You go from being inside a neighborhood to being alongside one. The Malecon connects both, and most walkers do not notice the exact point where Centro Habana ends and Vedado begins.</p>
