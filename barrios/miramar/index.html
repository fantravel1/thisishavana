By taxi, the trip to Vedado takes 10-15 minutes and to Habana Vieja around 20-30 minutes depending on traffic. Local buses (guaguas) run along Quinta Avenida and connect to central routes, though they are crowded and unreliable. Shared taxis (almendrones) offer an affordable middle option. The separation created by the river is more psychological than physical — once you cross, you are in a fundamentally different Havana, and the contrast is part of what makes Miramar worth understanding."

              <h2 class="section-header__title">The Embassy District</h2>
            </div>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">Miramar is where Havana exhales. West of the Almendares River, across from Vedado's tree-lined residential streets, this neighborhood unfolds along <strong>Quinta Avenida</strong> — one of the widest and most manicured boulevards in all of Cuba. The density and compression of central Havana dissolve here into something spacious, measured, and quiet.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">This is Havana's <strong>diplomatic quarter</strong>. Embassy compounds line the avenue behind iron gates and tropical gardens. International schools serve the children of diplomats. International restaurants — some of the best in the city — cater to a clientele that moves between missions and trade offices. The rhythm here is professional, not street-level.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">But Miramar's defining quality is not its embassies. It is the <strong>contrast</strong>. Grand mid-century mansions — originally built for Havana's elite before the Revolution — sit alongside deteriorating apartment blocks where families live with the same shortages as the rest of Cuba. The inequality that central Havana compresses into dense blocks is here stretched across wide avenues, made visible in the distance between a diplomatic compound's manicured lawn and a crumbling residential wall fifty meters away.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">The silence is what strikes you first. After the layered sound of Centro Habana — the street vendors, the domino games, the music from every open window — Miramar feels almost suburban. Streets are wide enough that sound dissipates. Conversations happen behind walls, not across balconies. This separation is not accidental. It is the architecture of a neighborhood built for privacy and distance, now operating as Havana's interface with the international world.</p>
            <p>Coming here after spending days in the compressed heart of Havana is like stepping into a different city entirely. The spaciousness is physical, but it is also psychological — a reminder that Havana contains multitudes, and that <strong>not all of them breathe at the same volume.</strong></p>

            <p class="rhythm-card__desc">The day begins with SUVs and diplomatic plates moving along Quinta Avenida. Embassy staff commute to their compounds. The streets are wide and orderly. There are no bread lines here, no vendor calls — just the quiet hum of an international district waking to its schedule. Joggers use the boulevard's median strip. Gardeners tend embassy grounds.</p>

            <h3 class="rhythm-card__title">Empty Wide Streets</h3>
            <p class="rhythm-card__desc">Miramar's afternoons are defined by their emptiness. The wide avenues amplify the tropical heat and the absence of foot traffic. Where Centro Habana compresses into shade-seeking crowds, Miramar simply empties out. The streets feel almost abandoned — too wide for a city this dense, designed for a population density that never materialized.</p>

            <h3 class="rhythm-card__title">International Dining</h3>
            <p class="rhythm-card__desc">Evening brings Miramar's most visible energy: its international restaurants. Some of Havana's best paladares operate here, serving diplomats, business travelers, and Cubans who can afford the prices. The dining scene is quieter, more polished, and more expensive than anywhere else in Havana. Outside, the streets remain wide and still.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="rhythm-card fade-in delay-4">
            <p class="rhythm-card__time">The Feeling</p>
            <h3 class="rhythm-card__title">Spaciousness After Density</h3>
            <p class="rhythm-card__desc">The most powerful experience of Miramar is arriving from Centro Habana or Habana Vieja. After days in compressed streets where every surface carries sound and life, Miramar's wide emptiness feels almost unreal. The space between buildings becomes the story. You begin to understand what Havana sounds like when it is not performing.</p>

            </div>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">Miramar's character is written in its <strong>geography</strong>. The wide avenues lined with ficus and royal palms, the set-back mansions behind gated walls, the embassy compounds with their flags and security — all of it communicates distance, order, and a relationship to the outside world that no other Havana neighborhood possesses.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">The <strong>tropical gardens</strong> are real here, not decorative. Embassy grounds are maintained to international standards. Private residences — many of them converted into casas particulares or boutique rentals — preserve the mid-century landscaping that the rest of Havana long ago sacrificed to density. Walking through Miramar's residential streets feels like stepping into a different decade and a different income bracket simultaneously.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;"><strong>International schools</strong> serve the diplomatic community. The Miramar Trade Center houses foreign business offices. The Russian Embassy — an enormous Brutalist structure — looms over Quinta Avenida as a reminder of Cold War alliances. Each embassy tells a geopolitical story through its architecture and level of maintenance.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">But the defining quality of Miramar is the <strong>visibility of inequality</strong>. In Centro Habana, poverty is compressed — everyone shares the same density, the same infrastructure stress. In Miramar, the gap is spatial. A diplomatic residence with a swimming pool and satellite dish sits across the street from a family living in a subdivided mansion with no running water after 2 PM. The contrast is not hidden; it is the neighborhood's fundamental texture.</p>
            <p>This makes Miramar uncomfortable and important. It is the neighborhood where Havana's relationship with money, power, and the international order is most <strong>legible</strong> — not in the compressed humanity of Centro Habana, but in the space between things.</p>

                <p>It is best as a complement to time spent in central neighborhoods, not as a sole base. Stay here if you want the contrast — the experience of crossing the river and feeling the city change around you. That transition is itself one of Havana's most revealing moments.</p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">Miramar connects to Vedado and central Havana via the tunnel under the Almendares River or the bridge crossing at Calle 23. By taxi, the trip to Vedado takes 10-15 minutes and to Habana Vieja around 20-30 minutes depending on traffic.</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">Local buses (guaguas) run along Quinta Avenida and connect to central routes, though they are crowded and unreliable. Shared taxis (almendrones) running fixed routes offer an affordable middle option between public transit and private taxis.</p>
                <p>The separation created by the river is more psychological than physical — once you cross, you are in a fundamentally different Havana. The contrast between Miramar's wide silence and Vedado's residential hum, or Centro Habana's full-volume street life, is part of what makes the crossing worth understanding.</p>

            <p class="aeo-block__answer">Miramar sits on the western side of the <strong>Almendares River</strong>, which serves as both a physical and psychological boundary between central Havana and the city's western districts. The river is narrow, but the transition it marks is profound.</p>
            <p class="aeo-block__answer">From Vedado, you cross via the <strong>tunnel beneath the river</strong> or the bridge at Calle 23. The tunnel deposits you directly onto Quinta Avenida, and the shift is immediate: the streets widen, the buildings pull back from the sidewalk, the sound changes. You go from Vedado's residential density to Miramar's diplomatic spaciousness in under a minute.</p>
            <p class="aeo-block__answer">This crossing is one of Havana's most <strong>revealing transitions</strong>. In central Havana, neighborhoods flow into each other — Habana Vieja bleeds into Centro Habana, Centro Habana merges into Vedado along the Malecon. But the river creates a hard boundary. Miramar does not flow from anything. It begins, deliberately, on the other side.</p>
            <p class="aeo-block__answer">For visitors, understanding this separation is understanding Havana's geography of power. The embassies are across the river for a reason. The space is across the river for a reason. <strong>Miramar was built to be separate</strong>, and that separation — now part of the neighborhood's daily reality — tells you as much about Havana as the compressed blocks of Centro Habana.</p>
