Vedado offers wide tree-lined streets, residential calm, universities, jazz clubs, and the Malecón. It suits longer stays, repeat visitors, and travelers who prefer a quieter home base. Old Havana offers colonial density, restored plazas, and walkable landmarks — ideal for first-time visitors who want to be surrounded by layered history. Many experienced travelers recommend staying in Vedado and exploring Old Havana as day trips, getting the best of both worlds."

The Malecón becomes an open-air gathering place every evening where locals far outnumber tourists. Vedado also has rooftop bars, theater performances at the Teatro Nacional, live music venues, and the Fabrica de Arte Cubano — a converted cooking-oil factory that is now Havana's most important cultural space. The nightlife in Vedado is more local, more cultural, and less tourist-oriented than Old Havana."

A walk from the University of Havana to Hotel Nacional takes about 20 minutes. The Malecón runs the full length of Vedado's northern edge. The grid layout makes navigation intuitive. Walking from Vedado into Centro Habana and Old Havana is entirely possible — many visitors walk the full route along the Malecón in about 45 minutes to an hour."

          "text": "The best areas for casas particulares in Vedado are the residential streets between Línea and 23 (La Rampa), roughly from Calle L to Calle 12. This central zone puts you within walking distance of the Malecón, the university, and Vedado's cultural venues. The streets around the University of Havana (near Calle L and San Lázaro) offer excellent value. Avoid the blocks immediately around the large hotels if you want a more local atmosphere. Vedado's casas tend to be more spacious than those in Old Havana, often with private balconies and better amenities at lower prices."

            </div>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">Vedado is where Havana thinks. If Old Havana is the city's memory and Centro Habana is its pulse, Vedado is its mind -- the neighborhood where universities, theaters, politics, and culture have shaped modern Cuba for over a century.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">The streets here are wide and tree-lined, the blocks are long, and conversations are longer. This is a neighborhood built for ideas, not density. <strong>Art Deco facades</strong> stand alongside Modernist mansions now divided into apartments. The University of Havana presides from its hilltop steps. The Malecón stretches along the northern edge, where every evening becomes an open-air gathering of students, lovers, musicians, and philosophers.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">Vedado holds some of Havana's most iconic landmarks: the <strong>Hotel Nacional</strong>, perched above the seawall like a monument to another era. <strong>Coppelia</strong>, the ice cream cathedral where Cubans queue for hours in a ritual that is as much social as it is culinary. Jazz clubs that stay alive until the early hours. The <strong>Necrópolis de Colón</strong>, one of the most important cemeteries in the Americas.</p>
            <p>Where Old Havana overwhelms you with layered centuries, Vedado invites you to slow down. Sit on a porch. Walk under the canopy of trees. Let a two-hour conversation happen over one cup of coffee. This neighborhood does not perform for visitors -- it simply lives, at its own expansive pace.</p>

            <blockquote>Old Havana is about layered time. Vedado is about ideas, culture, and the institutions that shaped modern Cuba.</blockquote>

          <div class="aeo-block__content">
            <h3 class="aeo-block__question">What makes Vedado feel different from the rest of Havana?</h3>
            <p class="aeo-block__answer">The first thing you notice is <strong>space</strong>. After the compression of Centro Habana and the tight colonial grid of Old Havana, Vedado opens up. The streets are wide. Trees form canopies overhead. Buildings have front gardens. There is air between things.</p>
            <p class="aeo-block__answer">The architecture tells a different story than the rest of Havana. Where Old Havana is colonial baroque and Centro Habana is 19th-century neoclassical, Vedado is <strong>20th-century modern</strong> -- Art Deco apartment buildings, Modernist villas, mid-century mansions now subdivided into multi-family residences. You can read the ambitions of pre-revolution Cuba in these facades: the desire to be cosmopolitan, forward-looking, part of the wider world.</p>
            <p class="aeo-block__answer">Vedado was planned as a residential neighborhood for the emerging Cuban middle and upper classes. That planning shows in the grid layout, the setback requirements that created front gardens, and the wide avenues designed for automobile culture. After the revolution, many of these grand homes were divided among multiple families, creating a unique social texture: <strong>former wealth living alongside revolutionary redistribution</strong>.</p>
            <p class="aeo-block__answer">The cultural institutions anchor everything. The University of Havana gives the neighborhood its intellectual energy. The theaters, galleries, and music venues give it creative pulse. The Hotel Nacional, perched on its bluff above the Malecón, gives it a sense of historical weight. And the Malecón itself -- Havana's great open-air living room -- ties Vedado to the rest of the city along a continuous seawall that changes character with every neighborhood it passes through.</p>

          <div class="aeo-block__content">
            <h3 class="aeo-block__question">How does Vedado compare to Old Havana?</h3>
            <p class="aeo-block__answer">They are different cities sharing the same coastline. Old Havana is <strong>dense, colonial, and tourist-facing</strong> -- narrow streets, restored plazas, centuries of history stacked in tight blocks. You are always in a scene there, surrounded by tour groups, photographers, and the weight of 500 years.</p>
            <p class="aeo-block__answer">Vedado is the opposite in almost every way. <strong>Spacious, 20th-century, and residential</strong> -- wide sidewalks, Art Deco facades, tree shade, and a pace that invites you to stop. Tourist density is low. The rhythm is local. You can sit on a porch for an hour and no one tries to sell you anything.</p>
            <p class="aeo-block__answer">In Old Havana, the architecture tells you about Spain, about colonialism, about power. In Vedado, the architecture tells you about <strong>Cuba's own ambitions</strong> -- the universities it built, the cultural institutions it established, the modern identity it was forging before and after the revolution. If Old Havana is where Havana remembers, Vedado is where Havana thinks.</p>

              <div class="faq-item__answer-inner">
                <p>Vedado and Old Havana are not better or worse -- they are fundamentally different experiences. Vedado offers wide tree-lined streets, residential calm, universities, jazz clubs, and the Malecón. It suits longer stays, repeat visitors, and travelers who prefer a quieter home base. Old Havana offers colonial density, restored plazas, and walkable landmarks -- ideal for first-time visitors who want to be surrounded by layered history.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">Many experienced travelers recommend staying in Vedado and exploring Old Havana as day trips. You get the best of both: a calm, spacious neighborhood to return to, and the full intensity of colonial Havana during the day. The two neighborhoods are connected by the Malecón -- about a 45-minute walk along the sea.</p>

              <h4>What is the nightlife like in Vedado?</h4>
              <span class="faq-item__icon">+</span>
            </button>
            <div class="faq-item__answer">
              <div class="faq-item__answer-inner">
                <p>Vedado has the most diverse nightlife in Havana. La Zorra y el Cuervo, Cuba's most famous jazz club, is an underground venue on La Rampa (Calle 23) that hosts world-class musicians nightly. The Malecón becomes an open-air social scene every evening, where locals far outnumber tourists. The Fabrica de Arte Cubano -- a converted cooking-oil factory -- is Havana's most important contemporary cultural space, combining art, music, film, and performance.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">Beyond the headline venues, Vedado's nightlife includes rooftop bars with views over the Malecón, theater performances at the Teatro Nacional, live music at smaller venues, and the kind of informal gatherings -- porch conversations, neighborhood parties -- that make up the real social fabric of Cuban evenings. The nightlife here is more local, more cultural, and less tourist-oriented than Old Havana's bar scene.</p>

          <!-- FAQ 3 -->
          <div class="faq-item">
            <button class="faq-item__question" aria-expanded="false">
              <h4>Is Vedado walkable?</h4>
              <span class="faq-item__icon">+</span>
            </button>
            <div class="faq-item__answer">
              <div class="faq-item__answer-inner">
                <p>Vedado is very walkable, though its scale is different from Old Havana. The streets are wider, the blocks are longer, and distances are greater. A walk from the University of Havana to Hotel Nacional takes about 20 minutes. The Malecón runs the full length of Vedado's northern edge, providing a continuous seaside promenade. The grid layout makes navigation intuitive -- numbered streets run roughly north-south, lettered streets east-west.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">Walking from Vedado into Centro Habana and Old Havana is entirely possible and highly recommended. Many visitors walk the full route along the Malecón in 45 minutes to an hour. The transition between neighborhoods is gradual -- you feel the streets tighten, the sounds increase, and the architecture shift from modern to colonial. Walking is how Havana's neighborhoods reveal their relationships to each other.</p>

          <!-- FAQ 4 -->
          <div class="faq-item">
            <button class="faq-item__question" aria-expanded="false">
              <h4>What are the best areas in Vedado for casas particulares?</h4>
              <span class="faq-item__icon">+</span>
            </button>
            <div class="faq-item__answer">
              <div class="faq-item__answer-inner">
                <p>The best areas for casas particulares in Vedado are the residential streets between Línea and Calle 23 (La Rampa), roughly from Calle L to Calle 12. This central zone puts you within walking distance of the Malecón, the university, and Vedado's cultural venues. The streets around the University of Havana -- near Calle L and San Lázaro -- offer excellent value and a lively student atmosphere.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">Avoid the blocks immediately around the large hotels if you want a more local atmosphere. Vedado's casas tend to be more spacious than those in Old Havana, often with private balconies, higher ceilings, and better amenities at lower prices. Many are in converted apartments within those grand mid-century buildings, giving you a lived experience of Vedado's architectural history. Your host family becomes your best guide to the neighborhood -- they know which jazz clubs are playing tonight and where to find the best coffee on the block.</p>

            <h3 class="aeo-block__question">Where does Vedado sit in Havana's geography?</h3>
            <p class="aeo-block__answer">Vedado flows naturally from <strong>Centro Habana</strong> to the east. The transition happens around <strong>La Rampa</strong> (Calle 23) and the Malecón -- suddenly the streets widen, buildings have setbacks and gardens, and the compression of Centro Habana releases into Vedado's spacious grid. It is the most dramatic atmospheric shift between any two Havana neighborhoods.</p>
            <p class="aeo-block__answer">To the west, Vedado connects to <strong>Miramar</strong> across the <strong>Almendares River</strong>. The river forms a natural boundary -- you cross via the tunnel under 5ta Avenida or the bridge at Calle 23. On the other side, Miramar's embassy district offers yet another Havana: wider still, quieter, more international, with a fundamentally different density and social texture.</p>
            <p class="aeo-block__answer">The <strong>Malecón</strong> ties everything together. This 7-kilometer seawall is Havana's spine, running from Old Havana through Centro Habana and along Vedado's entire northern coastline. Walking the Malecón from east to west, you experience three neighborhoods dissolving into each other -- the boundary is felt in atmosphere and rhythm, not in walls or signs.</p>
            <p class="aeo-block__answer">Most visitors who base themselves in Vedado find they can <strong>walk everywhere that matters</strong>. Centro Habana and Old Havana are day-trip walks along the coast. The university, cultural venues, and Malecón are all within the neighborhood. And at the end of the day, you return to wide streets and tree-lined quiet -- the intellectual heart of a city that never stops thinking.</p>
